## Inspiration
I created this project for CS50's Web Programming with Python and Javascript offered on edX. The premise behind this project was to develop a frontend email client using JavaScript (the full specifications for this project can be found [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/3/mail/). From this project, I became more familiar with the JavaScript programming language and APIs.
